The interface was entirely created by Marie.
This allows you to show the work done in the ocr, select an image and retrieve text.

To open it:

-enter "make all" in the terminal and let compile
- enter . /main in terminal
The interface will be displayed. To exit it, press the "quit" buttons or the cross at the top of the page because closing functions are associated.

- don’t forget to make clean if you want to restart the interface

- the images for the exemple in the rapport and the oral presentation are in the file images

Home page:

- press start to continue or quit to exit the interface


Menu:

- Click on "Modifying" to edit a document
-click on "Make OCR" to make an OCR
-click on "New Document" to create a new document
-click on who to exit the interface

Modifying:

- open a new document with the open button
- you can write and edit the document
- save as to save your document
-click on who to exit the interface

New Document:

- open new to open a new page -> mandatory otherwise nothing works
- write
- save as to save in the desired place and name 
-click on who to exit the interface

Make OCR:

- open a image to choose an image. bmp, if it is a different format, an error page will be displayed
- click smooth to see image with blurring in preprocessing 
-click smooth to see image with contrast in preprocessing
- press make ocr to retrieve the text that is automatically saved as a file with the name of textOCR (to edit it you can return and open it in the Modifying page)
-click on who to exit the interface

To retrieve documents, go to the folder where the file was saved and search for the correct file with the correct name chosen when saving in the dialog box. If you want to retrieve only the text of the OCR without modification: stay in this file and type "open textOCR"

Don’t forget to make it clean.


During the test on the school’s vm using Geoffroy:

- Warning appears indicating that at the next version of GTK the tools will no longer be available
-the dialog boxes always open behind the page a priori out of any of us have this problem on MAC, we must leave the full screen mode of the interface
