Explanations of binarization:

This binarization, this folder and the files contained in it were made by Marie with the files of pixels_operations and images_operations and the Matrix type of Geoffroy being located in Tools.

binarization. c = all functions required for binarization

To test this part:

- go to the test folder by doing "cd test"
- enter make all in terminal
- enter . /test in terminal

This make will test the binarization on 3 images present in the file and the result of the binarization will be in the file "new" "new1"
"new2".

- to open them, enter "open new", "open new1", "open new2" in the terminal

You can compare them with the initial photos "loremipsum.bmp", "lorem.bmp" and "gafa-stop.bmp"
