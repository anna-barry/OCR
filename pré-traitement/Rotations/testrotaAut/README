README ROTATION AUTO

In order to try some specific values and to be sure it is really working you can put an Image WITHOUT a rotation angle in the
directory "Img". Then call the function rotation on it with whatever angle you want in order the angle is between -15.00 to 15.00.
then the getSkewAngle() function should return you the angle of the rotate image.

Things you could get to modify:

        -The path of the image (default : "../testrotaAUT/Img/loremipsum.bmp")

        -The angle you want to try (default : "-2")
