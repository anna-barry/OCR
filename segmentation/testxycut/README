to see if XYCUT and RLSA works:

Open a terminal in this folder,

Write the following instructions:

make (enter)
./testxycut (enter)

when it is al finished

make clean

Then open at every new pictures that have appeared in this directory,
last_letter: the last letter that was cutted
last_word: the last word that was cutted
last_line: the last line that was cutted
last_paragraph: the last paragraph that was cutted

To see the original image, clic on lorem.bmp
To test with other images, you can add a new bmp file and rename it "lore.bmp"


The function being a group of recursive function, it only shows the last element that has been threw the function, the last elements being the last paragraph, last line, last word and last letter of the text, it only shows the last elements.

Unfortunately, for now I haven't found a way to register every word/letter that was created.

However, it saves the text in the "textOCR" file, only with a, spaces and going to the next line, looking at what's printed we can recognize the text's shape.
